# Goals for July research 2021
**First Project: lab work 2-3 days a week on the Pacific Oyster triploid temperature stress experiment #2 with Matt at Pt Whitney**
-So far I have been labeling oysters, measuring shell lengths, and feeding rate assays. Will eventually be in change of the citrate synthase assay as well.

**Second Project: Geoduck maturation control has been indefinitily on hold until Mac and Laura get back in town. The new goal is to attempt a serotonin spawn 
and then do buoyancy experiment on oocytes**
-hopefully this will get done the second/third week in July
-see google doc for procedure [procedure here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LlNSSM_CCGgkCFT7IP6CgZ836smjfcshRj29u6gJpcc/edit?disco=AAAAM1qQ1Yg&ts=60da1c79&usp_dm=true)

**Third Project: Fish Breeding Project:Mitochondrial activity as an indicator of resiliency and marker for pacific oyster breeding programs** 
-hopefully will start this project after Matt George's project finishes up
-The goal of this project is to provide a cost-effective method to easily test mitochondrial function in broodstock mollusks and quickly identify individuals, families or populations that have a high likelihood of survival in a warming ocean.
-Take healthy broodstock oysters and stress them out with temperature at three levels (15-20-25C) over 30 days. 
-We expect that there will be physiological and genetic signatures of performance in the best performing temperature stressed oysters that will be predictive of the survival or fitness of offspring phenotypes. 
-The impact of this study will further aid ongoing studies in the field of shellfish maturation control as well as helping conservation managers in selection of the fittest broodstock animals.
