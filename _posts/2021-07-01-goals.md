# Goals for July research 2021
**First Project: lab work 2-3 days a week on the Pacific Oyster triploid temperature stress experiment #2 with Matt at Pt Whitney**
-So far I have been labeling oysters, measuring shell lengths, and feeding rate assays. Will eventually be in change of the citrate synthase assay as well.

**Second Project: Geoduck maturation control has been indefinitily on hold until Mac and Laura get back in town. The new goal is to attempt a serotonin spawn 
and then do buoyancy experiment on oocytes**
-hopefully this will get done the second/third week in July
