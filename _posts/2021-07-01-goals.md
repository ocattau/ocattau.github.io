### Goals for July research 2021
# First Project: lab work 2-3 days a week on the Pacific Oyster triploid temperature stress experiment #2 with Matt at Pt Whitney
-So far I have been labeling oysters, measuring shell lengths, and feeding rate assays. Will eventually be in change of the citrate synthase assay as well.

# Second Project: Geoduck maturation control has been indefinitily on hold until Mac and Laura get back in town. The new goal is to attempt a serotonin spawn 
and then do buoyancy experiment on oocytes 
-hopefully this will get done the second/third week in July
-see google doc for procedure

# Third Project: Fish Breeding Project:Mitochondrial activity as an indicator of resiliency and marker for oyster breeding programs ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81712104/124839580-e2713080-df3d-11eb-99c4-e0b626de85b1.png)
-"Five different families of mature single parent crossed Pacific Oysters (C. gigas) will be obtained from Taylor Shellfish using standard industry practices. Each family will have 99 individuals split into three treatment levels (n=33). The mature oysters will be on a starvation diet and acclimated  to their treatment temperature over 48 hours. They will be stressed by temperature for 30 days at three different levels (15/20/25C) and monitored for survival, growth and metabolic activity. Oysters will be checked at day 0, 8, 15, 22 and 30 for mortality and survival. On day 0 and day 15, the routine metabolic rate (RMR) of individual oysters (3 oysters tank) will be measured using a closed respirometry system according to Parker et al. (2012). At the end of 30 days, the oysters will be clipped and the tissue will be preserved for preliminary RNA sequencing. After RMR measurements, the individual oysters will be euthanized and 50 mg of tissue from the adductor muscle and the digestive gland will be dissected, placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80 °C until further enzyme analysis. The remaining oyster tissue can be dried in a drying oven for 48hrs and weighed to determine dry tissue mass (DTM). At the cellular level, metabolic rates will be compared to measurements of mitochondrial metabolic function via citrate synthase enzyme activity following the procedure outlined in Farrell et al. (2015). For molecular analysis, QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq (Moll et al. 2014) will be used, as this will provide a significant increase in cost-efficiency compared to traditional RNA-seq.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81712104/124839605-ef8e1f80-df3d-11eb-9983-273436448167.png)
