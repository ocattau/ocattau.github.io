# Check to see if BioRad bovine serum albumin (BSA) Protocol works with oyster tissue

## if it does, use the results from the assay run to calculate total protein concentration per sample (ug/mL)
### I am going to want to use various dillutions of the samples so I can get the protein concentration in the linear range (<2000 ug/mL)

# Next is to run the Citrate-Synthase assay with samples

## Pay special attention for bubbles present, use tabletop centrifuge, pipette more carefully
### Run technical replicates on gill and mantle tissue
