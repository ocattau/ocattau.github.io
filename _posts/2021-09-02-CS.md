**Citrate-Synthase (CS) Test Run #1**
Today Matt George and I attempted to test out our [CS protocol](https://www.abcam.com/ps/products/239/ab239712/documents/ab239712_Citrate%20Synthase%20Assay%20Kit%20v1a%20(website).pdf) using the Varioscan spectrophotometer. The original settings on the machine was 1000 meaurements without any breaks, but at 25 seconds a measurement, that would mean the Variscan would have been running for 12.5 hours so I had to kill the scripts which deleted the data. I re-ran the machine 57 minutes later (20 minutes past the ideal time) and captured the very end of the absorbance curve with the absorbance spectrum centered at 412um. Results from the first test run can be found [here](https://www.docfly.com/editor/ea6b72a1a3095c6e5f3b/73r1t00xcjd-a5c5e9df)
