#The worst happened yesterday, 
my precious Prius way violated at Safeway and they took my baby! (By baby I mean my Macbook air that I had since college) and my smartphone. For the last 48 hours I have been without a phone and I realized how I rely on my phone to authenticate my identity. I cannot log into my apple ID without a 2-factor authorization which is problem because without my phone I cannot restore my new laptop to it's time machine back-up. Thankfully, I have an external hard drive that has all my college work on it but I didn't back it up since I started at UW this spring. All my work is on GitHub but my computer is *empty* which means that I am starting over from scratch with Jupyter Notebook. Maybe it will be a good exercise going through installing homebrew and kallisto again, so I know how it works intuatively. I have been stuggling with understanding where the computer stores my files so this should be a good opportunity to "clean up" my work. 

#On the research front,
The citrate-synthase kit arrived today and I will be going about testing what samples make sense to assay this week and early next week. Hopefully this assay kit will help me get my summer research project going in the correct direction. I also need to pick up a package for Sam today and put it in the -80C.
